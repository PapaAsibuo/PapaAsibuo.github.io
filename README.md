# PapaAsibuo.github.io
I am Papa Kofi Asibuo  and I'm from Ghana. Studying Computer Science& Engineering at Lehigh University.

I'm using github primarily for my Data Journalism class: From Stats to Stories, as well as to post some of my programming mini projects.

I love doing sports and I consider myself a social person. I am currently a first Year student at Lehigh.

I have interests in programming, web app development, and 3D Animating.
My programming languages are: Java, PHP, HTML, CSS, and some C# using ASP.NET.Core Razorpages, and I animate using the blender 2.79b software.

## Data Stories

![Where do lehigh students live?](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71460438/94185525-622c8380-fe73-11ea-9fdc-9db5a547c57d.png)

This infographic was created using Canva. It shows the percentages of Lehigh students that live on campus, off campus, and in sorority and fraternity housing.
I discovered that the largest percentage of undergraduate students in Lehigh live in residence halls. But that's no surprise. What was shocking was the large number of students living off campus (38.7%).

All statistics were obtained from Lehigh University's [Office of Institutional Research & Strategic Analytics](https://oirsa.lehigh.edu/sites/oirsa.lehigh.edu/files/LUprofile_2019.pdf)
