I am Papa Kofi Asibuo  and I'm from Ghana. Studying Computer Science& Engineering at Lehigh University.

I'm using github primarily for my Data Journalism class: From Stats to Stories, as well as to post some of my programming mini projects.

I love doing sports and I consider myself a social person. I am currently a first Year student at Lehigh.

I have interests in programming, web app development, and 3D Animating.
My programming languages are: Java, PHP, HTML, CSS, and some C# using ASP.NET.Core Razorpages, and I animate using the blender 2.79b software.

This visualization reveals that the largest percentage of undergraduate students in Lehigh live in residence halls. But that's no surprise. 

All statistics were obtained from Lehigh University's [Office of Institutional Research & Strategic Analytics](https://oirsa.lehigh.edu/sites/oirsa.lehigh.edu/files/LUprofile_2019.pdf)

While creating this infographic,  it was discovered that a number of things made it harder to empathize with the people in study. For example: these events were so long ago (in a time without cameras) as such, the subtitute of pictures with paintings. The use of the word "slave" is another example.

Here are links to all the sources of information used in making this timeline:

These visualizations were created to illustrate the popularity of off campus parties in Lehigh University, as well as to assess the safety of students at these parties. Safety was assessed by asking whether students have ever felt unsafe at these off campus parties. These results were obtained from a survey sent out in the 2015-2016 academic year. Off campus parties proved to be very popular with (99%) of students that responded having been to one. They also proved to be a relatively safe form of partying with (56.6%) of students never feeling unsafe at an off campus party.
