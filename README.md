# PapaAsibuo.github.io
I am Papa Kofi Asibuo  and I'm from Ghana. Studying Computer Science& Engineering at Lehigh University.

I'm using github primarily for my Data Journalism class: From Stats to Stories, as well as to post some of my programming mini projects.

I love doing sports and I consider myself a social person. I am currently a first Year student at Lehigh.

I have interests in programming, web app development, and 3D Animating.
My programming languages are: Java, PHP, HTML, CSS, and some C# using ASP.NET.Core Razorpages, and I animate using the blender 2.79b software.

# Data Stories

## Infographics

### Where do lehigh students live?
![Where do lehigh students live?](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71460438/94185525-622c8380-fe73-11ea-9fdc-9db5a547c57d.png)

This infographic was created using Canva. It shows the percentages of Lehigh students that live on campus, off campus, and in sorority and fraternity housing.
I discovered that the largest percentage of undergraduate students in Lehigh live in residence halls. But that's no surprise. What was shocking was the large number of students living off campus (38.7%).

All statistics were obtained from Lehigh University's [Office of Institutional Research & Strategic Analytics](https://oirsa.lehigh.edu/sites/oirsa.lehigh.edu/files/LUprofile_2019.pdf)


### Lehigh's undergraduate population by ethnicity

I created this infographic to show the different races (and their proportions) within the Lehigh Undergraduate community. 
This data was obtained from the student profile section of the [University Statistics](https://www1.lehigh.edu/about/university-statistics) page on Lehigh University's website.

While creating this infographic, I realized a number of things made it harder to empathize with the people in study. For example: these events were so long ago (in a time without cameras) as such, the subtitute of pictures with paintings. The use of the word "slave" is another example.

Here are links to all the sources of information used in making this timeline:

### Best basketball player in terms of points per game

This bar chart shows Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant, and Lebron James, with their average points per game in their basketball career at age 34. In light of the NBA Final this weekend, I watched and admired the way Lebron James played. I began to believe that he's the greatest player of all time. As such, I turned to search for the facts. According to the data I found, Lebron James actually comes out third in the race. 
Data for this bar chart was obtained from [the sports rush website.](https://thesportsrush.com/comparing-lebron-james-michael-jordan-and-kobe-bryant-in-their-age-34-season/)
