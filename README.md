I am Papa Kofi Asibuo  and I'm from Ghana. Studying Computer Science& Engineering at Lehigh University.

I'm using github primarily for my Data Journalism class: From Stats to Stories and for my Data Storytelling class, as well as to post the code to some of my programming projects. I picked up this class to explore the applications of data science, as well as to broaden my scope of knowledge through the journalism aspect.

I love doing sports and I consider myself a social person. I am currently a first Year student at Lehigh.

I have interests in programming, web app development, and 3D Animating.
My programming languages are: Java, PHP, HTML, CSS, and some C# using ASP.NET.Core Razorpages, and I animate using the blender 2.79b software.

## Infographics

## Where do lehigh students live? (2019)
![Where do lehigh students live?-2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71460438/100537210-5916b480-321e-11eb-82d4-10e7a3116387.png)

This infographic was created using Canva. It shows the percentages of Lehigh students that live on campus, off campus, and in sorority and fraternity housing.
This visualization reveals that the largest percentage of undergraduate students in Lehigh live in residence halls followed by off campus housing, and then fraternity and sorority housing respectfully. This is a regular trend in other years due to the limited properties available for rent in the Bethlehem area as off campus housing, as well as the fixed number of fraternity and sorority houses on Lehigh Campus.

All statistics were obtained from Lehigh University's [Office of Institutional Research & Strategic Analytics](https://oirsa.lehigh.edu/sites/oirsa.lehigh.edu/files/LUprofile_2019.pdf)


## Lehigh's undergraduate population by ethnicity (2019)

![2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71460438/100562957-12c06480-32b5-11eb-8628-46e6ce152a22.png)

This infographic was created to show the different races (and their proportions) within the Lehigh Undergraduate community. When students conducting college research look at Lehigh, it often surfaces in student reviews that the institution's population is predominantly white in race. This pie chart validates the truth behind the popular claim, and puts the number of white people into context by using percentages as well as including the other races and their respective percentages. It ultimately paints a pitcure of how diverse Lehigh University is. This data was obtained from the student profile section of the [University Statistics](https://www1.lehigh.edu/about/university-statistics) page on Lehigh University's website.

This is a timeline showing the key happenings in the history of Le-Laf, the Lehigh- Lafayette football rivalry. This timeline was created using [Timeline.js](http://timeline.knightlab.com).

## A history of Slave Trade

<iframe src='https://cdn.knightlab.com/libs/timeline3/latest/embed/index.html?source=1KritiNP341rte0x-M1J4zXfpLGmsivEvk3EewjSO8KQ&font=Default&lang=en&initial_zoom=2&height=650' width='100%' height='650' webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen frameborder='0'></iframe>

This timeline was created to outline the major events in Slave Trade and events that contributed to its abolition. Various techniques were employed to ensure that the people in study were not seen as just " numbers" or " inanimate objects", but rather as humans. While creating this visualization, it was uncovered that a number of things made it harder to empathize with the people in study. Two key examples are the fact that these events were so long ago (in a time without cameras) as such, the subtitute of pictures with paintings as well as the use of the word "slave" to refer to people made the bad things that happened to them seem expected or justified to some extent. This timeline was created using [Timeline.js](http://timeline.knightlab.com).

Here are links to all the sources of information used in making this timeline:

## Best basketball player in terms of points per game

![Nba_Player_vs _Points_per_game_(age_34_season)_Points_per_game_(age_34_season)_chartbuilder-2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71460438/95696540-8628ec80-0c09-11eb-891d-693412c5e5a5.png)

This bar chart shows Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant, and Lebron James, with their average points per game in their basketball career at age 34. Their age 34 season was chosen because it proved to be a relatively successful season for all 3 athletes with Michael Jordan taking the Chicago Bulls to the NBA finals and emerging victorious, and Lebron James with one of the highest PPG's(Points per game) of his career. Although Kobe's age 34 season was not the LA Lakers' best season, he made it to the all NBA 1st team.  This infographic shows Lebron coming in 3rd place and Michael Jordan coming in 1st place. Data for this bar chart was obtained from [the sports rush website.](https://thesportsrush.com/comparing-lebron-james-michael-jordan-and-kobe-bryant-in-their-age-34-season/) and [fadeawayworld.net](https://fadeawayworld.net/2019/03/17/comparing-michael-jordan-lebron-james-and-kobe-bryant-at-age-34/)

## Lehigh's Student Enrollment into various colleges over time

![Population_of_Lehigh's_top_3_Colleges_for_the_past_5_years_Arts_ _Sciences_Engineering_Business_chartbuilder-2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71460438/96169752-a0f0af00-0ef0-11eb-98a9-72b2bc2cdb7d.png)

 This line graph shows how the population of Lehigh University's top 3 colleges over time. In 2015, the School of Engineering was the most populous, with Arts & Sciences in second place and Business in third. Currently, Arts& Sciences has the most students, followed by Engineering, and lastly Business in a steady third place. Data for this graph was obtained from Lehigh University's [Office of Institutional Research & Strategic Analytics](https://oirsa.lehigh.edu/university-profile)
 
## Parent Income vs Child Income

![Parent_income_vs_Child_Income_k_mean_chartbuilder](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71460438/96173475-ecf22280-0ef5-11eb-8d7c-50e7f7cf2989.png)

This scatter plot depicts the relationship between parent income and child income. The positive correlation in the data shows that child income is directly proportional to Parent income. This data backs the popular claim that once born into poverty it is very difficult for one to make their way to riches. This data was obtained from [Harvard University's Opportunity Insights](https://opportunityinsights.org/data/).

## Lehigh University Acceptance Rate over time

![Lehigh_University_Acceptance_Rate_over_time_Acceptance_Rate_chartbuilder-2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71460438/97132474-73400d00-171d-11eb-935f-53580ba3c102.png)

This line graph shows how the selectivity of Lehigh University has changed over time. The acceptance rate of Lehigh University has ultimately decreased over the past 10 years years. With the highest in 2010(37.9%) and the lowest in 2018(22.3%). There is a large spike from 2018 to 2019. During this period, Lehigh experienced a decrease in applicants, and in order to maintain (roughly) the same number of students, Lehigh granted a similar number of admissions. Because it is ultimately the same number of admits out of a lesser number of applicants, this provided a greater percentage of admits, which explains the spike after 2018.

Data for this line graph was obtained from [AcceptanceRate.com](http://www.acceptancerate.com/schools/lehigh-university) and [CollegeTuitionCompare.com](https://www.collegetuitioncompare.com/trends/lehigh-university/admission/).

These visualizations were created to illustrate the popularity of off campus parties in Lehigh University, as well as to assess the safety of students at these parties.  Off campus parties proved to be very popular with (99%) of students that responded having been to one. They also proved to be a relatively safe form of partying with (56.6%) of students never feeling unsafe at an off campus party. It was surprising to find out that more males than females had felt unsafe at off campus parties, as off campus housing is a popular residence location for fraternity members that are not residing in fraternity houses (as they have limited space). As such, they would be present at off campus parties. This male dominance was expected to contribute to  more females than males feeling unsafe at off campus parties, but this was not the case. Safety was assessed by asking whether students have ever felt unsafe at these off campus parties. Unsafe conditions can refer to anything from a student being scared of a group of suspicious looking people down the street to a student being robbed at gunpoint: essentially anything that can make one feel uncomfortable. These [results](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1M3fvI1f7l4QP_zvlo5YA405N-6oZXp8SA1btxvsUyeI/edit?usp=sharing) were obtained from a [survey](https://coursesite.lehigh.edu/pluginfile.php/3509582/course/section/2571305/Lehigh%20Party%20Scene%20Survey.pdf) sent out in the 2015-2016 academic year.

Lehigh’s status as a predominantly white institution is well known. As such, it is worth investigating whether this is because multicultural people do not apply to Lehigh or whether it is due to admissions officers not granting multicultural students admission into Lehigh. The data for this was obtained by way of a data request from Lehigh University’s office of statistics and institutional research. As the most recent data (pupils applying into Lehigh’s Class of 2024) was not readily available on the internet. The study uncovered that such a huge proportion (91%) of Lehigh applicants went to high school in the United States. This gives insight into how or why Lehigh University is a predominantly white institution.

Since the bulk of the applicants were from America, it seemed worthwhile to investigate the diversity of backgrounds of Lehigh students when scaled down to solely the United States of America. We found that the largest numbers of applicants were from Pennsylvania and the surrounding areas. There were Lehigh applicants from almost all states (49/50) , a good assessment of the University’s popularity, However it is difficult to assess whether or not this is the cause of lehigh’s current ethnic diversity, or lack thereof. This is because there are different levels of diversity in different areas in the United States.

Based on the findings, international students make up a mere (9%) of Lehigh University applicants. However, Lehigh’s main contributors within the USA are New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania. This implies that Lehigh is more diverse than it may seem, as, out of these three, New York and New Jersey are in the top 10 most ethnically diverse states according to [WalletHub](https://wallethub.com/edu/most-least-diverse-states-in-america/38262).
